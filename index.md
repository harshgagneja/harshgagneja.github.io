# Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 10, Part 1

Working on this lab was enjoyable because it allowed me to manipulate and analyze county data in a fun and practical way. Implementing functions like AllCountiesString to concatenate county names and CountyPopulation to find specific populations felt like solving little puzzles. Additionally, calculating the total state population with StatePopulation gave me a sense of accomplishment as I saw the data come together.

Lab 1, Part 1

Working on this simple hello.cc program was enjoyable because it provided a quick and satisfying way to see immediate results. Writing a basic main function that prints "Hello Yasmin!" to the console was a great way to practice using standard input/output in C++. It was fun to see how a few lines of code can create a friendly greeting, making programming feel more personal and interactive.

Lab 2, Part 1

Working on this madlib.cc program was a lot of fun because it allowed me to create a simple interactive game. Asking the user to input a singular noun, a plural noun, and a present tense verb, and then using those inputs to generate a humorous and personalized story, made the coding experience enjoyable and engaging. It was satisfying to see how a few lines of code could create a playful and dynamic interaction with the user.
