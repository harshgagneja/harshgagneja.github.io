# Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 10, Part 1
Working on this lab was enjoyable because it allowed me to manipulate and analyze county data in a fun and practical way. Implementing functions like AllCountiesString to concatenate county names and CountyPopulation to find specific populations felt like solving little puzzles. Additionally, calculating the total state population with StatePopulation gave me a sense of accomplishment as I saw the data come together.
